### About the article
This paper presents BuilDroid, an LLM-based tool that builds arbitrary third-party native Android projects by fixing build errors through an iterative process. It was accepted to the Conference of Automated Software Engineering.

I am the main author and developer of the program, and since I wasn't following the proper steps of software development back then, I ran into a lot of issues with messy code and debugging. That's why I chose this article, to look back and see how much better BuilDroid (and my own workflow) could have been if I had used professional SE principles from the start.
